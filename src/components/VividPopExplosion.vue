Focus on creating a lively atmosphere with contrasting, saturated tones and dynamic lighting. Use a mix of asymmetrical and balanced compositions to create a playful visual flow. Render in 8K with a hyper-maximalist approach using Octane Render for vibrant, high-gloss textures and photorealistic lighting effects. Include:'
